# Week 4: Tool Use

## Why this matters
LLMs are isolated. Tools (Function Calling) give them "hands" to interact with the world, APIs, and databases.

## Core Concepts
- **Function Definitions**: Describing tools to the model.
- **Tool Execution**: parsing arguments and running code.

## The interface between text and action
Bridging the gap between natural language intention and structured API calls.
