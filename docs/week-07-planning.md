# Week 7: Planning and Decomposition

## Why this matters
Complex goals cannot be solved in one step. Agents must break them down into manageable sub-tasks.

## Core Concepts
- **Decomposition**: Splitting high-level goals.
- **Task Trees**: Hierarchical planning.

## Breaking a "Hero" goal into "Zero" tasks
Strategies for effective planning and sub-goal refinement.
