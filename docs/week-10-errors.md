# Week 10: Error Handling

## Why this matters
Agents fail. Recovering gracefully is what makes a system robust.

## Core Concepts

- **Guardrails**: Validation layers.
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff.

## Implementing "Guardrails" for safety
Strategies to validate outputs before showing them to users.
