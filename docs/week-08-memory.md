# Week 8: Memory Systems

## Why this matters
Stateless agents have no continuity. Memory systems allow agents to learn and remember users over time.

## Core Concepts
- **Short-term Memory**: Context window management.
- **Long-term Memory**: Vector stores and databases.

## Using databases to help an agent "remember" you
Designing persistence for agentic conversations.
