# Week 1: The Anatomy of an Agent

## Why this matters
Before building agents, we must understand what distinguishes them from standard software or passive chatbots. An agent is not just a model; it is a system that can perceive, reason, and act.

## Core Concepts
- **Reasoning**: The ability to plan and decide.
- **Action**: The ability to execute tools.
- **Observation**: The ability to perceive results.

## The transition from Static Software to Dynamic Agents
Traditional software is deterministic. Agents are probabilistic and goal-oriented.

$$ Agent = Model + Tools + Environment $$

## Key Takeaways
- Agents Loop: Observe -> Think -> Act -> Observe.
