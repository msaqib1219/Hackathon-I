# Introduction to Learning Agentic AI from Zero to Hero

## Why Agentic AI?

Agentic AI represents the next evolution in artificial intelligence, where systems don't just respond to queries but autonomously pursue goals through reasoning, action, and self-correction. Understanding this paradigm is essential for non-technical professionals to grasp how AI will transform workflows, decision-making, and innovation across industries.

Systems thinking reveals agentic AI as interconnected feedback loops: observe environment, reason about state, act with tools, reflect on outcomes – mimicking biological intelligence.

## How Agentic AI Works (High-Level)

Agents operate via structured prompts that guide LLMs through Chain of Thought reasoning, tool use (function calling), and memory management.

**Example math concept**: The agent's decision utility can be modeled as \\( U = R(o) + \\gamma \\max_a Q(s',a) \\), where \\( R \\) is reward from observation \\( o \\), \\( \\gamma \\) discount factor, and \\( Q \\) action-value.
