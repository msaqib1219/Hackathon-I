# Week 5: The ReAct Framework

## Why this matters
Reasoning without acting is hallucination. Acting without reasoning is dangerous. ReAct combines them in a tight loop.

## Core Concepts
- **ReAct Loop**: Thought -> Action -> Observation -> Thought.
- **Trace Analysis**: Reading ReAct traces.

## Synergizing Reasoning and Acting
Implementing the basic agent loop.
