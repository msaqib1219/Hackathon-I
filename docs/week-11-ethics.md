# Week 11: The Ethics of Autonomy

## Why this matters
Autonomous agents impact the real world. We must ensure they align with human values and safety standards.

## Core Concepts
- **Human-in-the-loop (HITL)**: Requiring approval for high-stakes actions.
- **Transparency**: Making reasoning visible.

## Designing for transparency and accountability
Building trust through explainability.
