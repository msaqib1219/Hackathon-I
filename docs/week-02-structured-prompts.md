# Week 02: Structured Prompts

## Why Structured Prompts?

Structured prompts provide reliability by constraining LLM output to expected formats, reducing hallucinations. Essential for production agents where consistency matters.

Systems thinking: Prompts as input shaping the entire agent feedback loop.

## How

Use JSON schemas, few-shot examples.

Math: Prompt entropy reduction \\( H(p) = -\\sum p_i \\log p_i \\).
