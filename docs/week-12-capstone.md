# Week 12: Building the Capstone

## Why this matters
Theory without practice is empty. This capstone integrates all 11 weeks into a single working system.

## The Challenge
Build an assistant that can perform a real-world task autonomously.

## Final Reflections
"The best programs are written so that they can be read by people, and only incidentally for machines to execute." — Abelson & Sussman

### Systems Thinking Formula
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Reasoning_i + Action_i) \times Safety = \text{Robust Autonomy} $$
