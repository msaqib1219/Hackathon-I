# Week 6: External Knowledge (RAG)

## Why this matters
Agents need access to private or up-to-date data not in their training set. RAG provides this memory.

## Core Concepts
- **Embeddings**: Vector representation of text.
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant context.
- **Augmentation**: Injecting context into the prompt.

## Giving your agent a library
How agents look up facts they weren't trained on.
