# Week 2: The Power of Language

## Why this matters
Language is the interface for agents. Precise language (prompt engineering) allows us to "program" the probabilistic behavior of the model.

## Core Concepts
- **Context Windows**: The working memory of the agent.
- **Structured IO**: Moving from chat to JSON/Function calling.

## Writing as Programming
Refining instructions to reduce ambiguity.
