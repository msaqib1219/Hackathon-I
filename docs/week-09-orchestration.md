# Week 9: Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Why this matters
Single agents have limitations. Specialized agents working together can solve broader classes of problems.

## Core Concepts
- **Manager-Worker Pattern**: Hierarchical delegation.
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Collaborative solving.

## Conflict resolution when two agents disagree
Handling handoffs and consensus in multi-agent systems.
